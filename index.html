    <h3>Biography</h3>
<p>
    I am currently a Computer science major with a passion for learning more about programming.
    I would definitely say that I would love to learn more about web design and pursuing my passion in it. <br>
    My passion is being able to travel and experience new things with friends and family, photography isn't my passion but I do enjoy creating memories and having pictures to look back on those fun times. <br>
    The best days are spending quality time with others and enjoying the simple things in life watching movies together or just talking with one another is nice. 
    I am not sure what path in programming I would like to take. However, I do know I enjoy learning about programming and would love to continuously learn more on creating certain aspects.

<!-- A simple section explaining the hover effect with a seperate section id from the photogallery to be able to edit independantly-->
<section id="HoverE">
    <h4> Explanation of the hover effect!</h4>
<p>The Image hover feature is greatly popular amongst various types of CSS animation! The hover effect not only allows the user to know that the website is interactive. But it also can be attached to various items and not just images alone. <br>
     To add the hover effect to images, its best recommended to do it in a grid as that would be the easier way I've discovered to add all the components to CSS and HTML.</p>

    <br> <h5> Step 1</h5>
<p>
    Add div class="grid", Then div class="img-wrapper", Along with img class="blur" src="(insert image link here)",
    Finally add div class="content fade" - Then the text you would like to display. <Br>
    <BR>
    Step one is just setting up your HTML for the magic to happen in your CSS sheet.
</p>

<br><h5> Step 2</h5>
<p>
    Set the images you chose into a grid, using the .grid - display : grid; and grid template colomns.
    <br>Then start with your Image wraper and its various forms, when adding your position, it needs to be abolute along with an inset of 0. <br>
     This would be used to add the blur to the image along with the look of your image at this point.
</p>

 <br><h5> Step 3</h5>
<p>
    Add your Image wrapper / content fade and play around with the opacity to your liking. <br>
    Then just like that, youre finished!

            Later in the day he sent for me. Ordinarily I would not have come without special reason, but just at present I am so interested in him that I would gladly make an effort. Besides, I am glad to have anything to help to pass the time. Harker is out, following up clues; and so are Lord Godalming and Quincey. Van Helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the Harkers; he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue. He does not wish to be disturbed in the work, without cause. I would have taken him with me to see the patient, only I thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again. There was also another reason: Renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and I were alone.
            I found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool, a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part. When I came in, he said at once, as though the question had been waiting on his lips:--
            "What about souls?" It was evident then that my surmise had been correct. Unconscious cerebration was doing its work, even with the lunatic. <br> I determined to have the matter out. "What about them yourself?" I asked. He did not reply for a moment but looked all round him, and up and down, as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer.
            "I don't want any souls!" he said in a feeble, apologetic way. The matter seemed preying on his mind, and so I determined to use it--to "be cruel only to be kind." So I said:--
            "You like life, and you want life?"
            "Oh yes! but that is all right; you needn't worry about that!"
            "But," I asked, "how are we to get the life without getting the soul also?" This seemed to puzzle him, so I followed it up:--
            "A nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out there, with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you. You've got their lives, you know, and you must put up with their souls!" Something seemed to affect his imagination, for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes, screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped. There was something pathetic in it that touched me; it also gave me a lesson, for it seemed that before me was a child--only a child, though the features were worn, and the stubble on the jaws was white. It was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance, and, knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself, I thought I would enter into his mind as well as I could and go with him. The first step was to restore confidence, so I asked him, speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears:--
            "Would you like some sugar to get your flies round again?" He seemed to wake up all at once, and shook his head. With a laugh he replied:--
            "Not much! flies are poor things, after all!" After a pause he added, "But I don't want their souls buzzing round me, all the same."
            "Or spiders?" I went on.
            "Blow spiders! What's the use of spiders? There isn't anything in them to eat or"--he stopped suddenly, as though reminded of a forbidden topic.
            "So, so!" I thought to myself, "this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word 'drink'; what does it mean?" Renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse, for he hurried on, as though to distract my attention from it:--
